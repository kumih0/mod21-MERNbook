>>**Note:** Due to issues involving Brave's browser support with the Apollo GQL sandbox, (https>http local network), I've installed mkcert through brew to provide a free CA.

To find out more about this cool super useful tool, ![click here](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) or ![here](https://words.filippo.io/mkcert-valid-https-certificates-for-localhost/).

To configure your server to accept SSL certificates at your terminating endpoint (localhost), you can ![read the Apollo documentation here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/security/terminating-ssl/) for set up and more information.
